# pandas-challenge

In this challenge we were given a Jupyter Notebook with questions pertaining to:
    schools_complete.csv
    students_complete.csv

We merged these documents into a single dataframe.

District Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:
    Total number of unique schools
    Total students
    Total budget
    Average math score
    Average reading score
    % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Include the following:
    School name
    School type
    Total students
    Total school budget
    Per student budget
    Average math score
    Average reading score
    % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
